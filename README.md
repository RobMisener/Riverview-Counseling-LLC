* Application for mental health record keeping (C++, SDL, SQLite) - Work In Progress

## Installation:
* Please download the release folder to run the exe. Current Features: As of now, you can enter in patient information, store it, and retrieve the information for display on screen. It currently has a main menu, a text entry screen, and a screen that displays the contents of the database. 

## Languages: 
* C++, SQLite, SDL

## Description: 
* This is a project designed for a mental health counseling business. It keeps track of patient information through a local SQLite database that is stored in a file in the folder. The program also displays the contents of the datbase back to the user if the user chooses. 
* No  server is required for an SQLite database as the database is stored in a local file in the program folder that does not require any internet connection. All graphics were created by myself. More content will be added in the near future.
