* Application for mental health record keeping (C++, SDL, SQLite) - Work In Progress

## Installation:
* The application works and will run. There are features, however, that are not fully implemented yet. As of now, you can enter in patient information, store it, and retrieve the information for display on screen. It has a main menu, a text entry screen, and a screen that displays the contents of the database. The project is made using SDL, which requires linking to specific directories in the project properties menu in visual studio, so you may need to update the paths to the path where you installed the folders from this project.

## Languages: 
* C++, SQLite, SDL

## Description: 
* This is a project designed for a mental health counseling business. It keeps track of patient information through a local SQLite database that is stored in a file in the folder. The program also displays the contents of the datbase back to the user if the user chooses. No  server is required for an SQLite database as the database is stored in a local file that does not require any internet connection. All graphics were created by myself. Program runs and many features are already complete. More will be added in the near future.
