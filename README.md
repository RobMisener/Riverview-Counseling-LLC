## Installation:
* Please build and run application. If there are any issues you can contact me and I can help. 
 * Current Features: As of now, you can enter in patient information, store it, and retrieve the information for display on screen.

## Languages / Libraries: 
* C++, SDL, SQLite 
* SDL is a simple direct media layer used for code based graphic manipulation. 
* SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, SQL database engine. It is used in many mobile applications for local database storage and also in many professional games such as Rome Total War II, as a means to store saved data.

## Description: 
* This is a project designed for a mental health counseling business. It keeps track of patient information through a local SQLite database that is stored in a file in the folder. The program also displays the contents of the datbase back to the user if the user chooses.

* No  server is required for an SQLite database as the database is stored in a local file in the program folder that does not require any internet connection. All graphics were created by myself. More content will be added in the near future.
